My name is Denis Poifol, i am a software engineer at FABERNOVEL, where I develop iOS applications. I love exploring new concepts about iOS or swift, and am very enthusiastic about sharing what I learned from it.
Among the topics I love the most are: generics and finding out new ways to do more, with less work, using protocol oriented programming or a clean architecture.
I am also involved in organising Cocoaheads events in Lyon, where I seize the opportunity to speak when possible.
